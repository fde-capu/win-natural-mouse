# Windows 10 - Natural Mouse and Normal Mouse
## ===========================================
### by fde-capu

Yep; Apple is going for the "natural mouse" gesture. You now scroll your mouse-wheel as if touching a device.

Makes sense.

But it is hard for us humans to switch neuron connections in our brains. Even if it they are only two neuron connections that just need to cross.

If you work back and forth on Mac and MS, this is probably the reason you landed here.

#### If you would like to invert your mouse wheel ####

(MS-Windows did not yet give us this toggle)

...

Make good use of this script, at your own risk.

- Usage:
		- Option 1
				- Right click the **ps1** file and go **Run with Powershell**.
		- Option 2
				- Edit the **lnk** to correspond your folders (not mine), so you can further on bypass the *Option 1* two clicks and use a *double click* instead.
		- Option 2 **Extra**
				- Put the **lnk** files into your `%appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu` folder, then you can
				- right click and pin them to the Start Menu
		- Option 3
				- Stick these files into your ______! <-- name any *folder* or *shortcut bar* you want.

### TO DO:

[ ] Have an option to *switch* from a single script instead of having two scripts.

[ ] Turn this scripts into an app, to be loaded into taskbar.
